This game's framework is from the step-by-step tutorial provided to me to make a phaser game, but I think I have successfully made it my own. I made all of my own assets (except for the bomb, never got around to changing that). I added sound effects, score and lives counters, new "levels" every three rounds, and a game over screen.

My personal best is currently round 9, can you beat it?
