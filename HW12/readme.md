I don't think I quite understand some of the parameters for this assignment. I don't know if I created the right amount of JSON objects, or put them in the right place. I'm going to turn it in as is because right now it does do what it seems you're wanting it to do, but my code and file structure might not be what is being asked for. If this is the case, I would like some instruction (perhaps in office hours) on how to complete the assignment correctly.
