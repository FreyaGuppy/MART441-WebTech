        <p id="about-me-body">Hi, I'm Freya. I am currently a third-year art major with a cirtificate in web design. I will be applying for a BFA in printmaking this semester.</p>
        <p id="about-me-body">I enjoy creating and learning about art in all of its forms, but have been focusing on printmaking recently. I hope to create a graphic novel or comic series some day.</p>

            <div id="japan-body">
                <p>I will be traveling to Japan for (at least) two weeks in May for a study abroad program focused on manga and other tradidtional art practices of Japan, specifically in Kyoto.</p>
            <p>I am very excited about this trip because I have never traveled over seas. I have been learning a lot about Japanese culture through firsthand social media accounts recently (my algorithm has definitely figured out I'm going to Japan soon) and I am excited to see it all in person. Japan is beautiful and so culturally differnt from here. My faimly is convinced I will thrive there and half expect me to never return. I don't think I'd go that far, but I do think it will be a life changing experience.</p>

            <h1>A memory of playing a game</h1>
            <p id="memory-body">I live near the Missoula Public Library. At the library, they have a decent collection of board games that you can check out, so, frequently, when I have friends over, we will pop over to the library to see if there are any games that look interesting. Recently, I checked out the card game, <i>Gubs. Gubs</i> is pretty simple, "a game of wit and luck," as it states on the tin. But the worldbuilding is very cute and silly. My roommate and I grew quite fond of it after a couple of playthroughs. She often has a hard time grasping or enjoying more complex games, they're just not her thing. But <i>Gubs</i> was one we could pull out and play together when others came over. Simple, quick, silly, it has become a favorite for casual play with a special place in my heart.</p>
