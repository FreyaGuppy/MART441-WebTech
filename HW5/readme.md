## Reflection
I still feel like I am getting by with minimal understanding of the code. I understand it enough to manipulate it after seeing the example, but I do not fully understand a lot of what it is doing and could not write something like this from scratch. 

## ChatGPT
This week, ChatGPT did the bare minimum visually. When I plugged in my images, the program worked as intended but there was no title and no visual embellishments. I have found that it is convenient to use ChatGPT because you can ask it to explain specific parts of its code in more detail. It did some interesting things that I don't fully grasp, like the way that it made sure there were two of each image using the spread operator "...". Once again its script is concise, making it easy to interpret.
