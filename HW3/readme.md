## ChatGPT's work

I fed the assignment into ChatGPT which gave me a visually appealing, but overall boring result. The JavaScript it wrote was somewhat different from what I ended up with. I liked some of the styling choices it made. I may impliment some of those going forward, specifically what it did with the buttons. But its story was boring and unsatisfying. There was only one ending (if you could call it that) and everything else went in circles. It left out the "adventure."

## My successes, challenges, and how I overcame them

I didn't know where to start so I took a look at the example code. I ended up using it as a template and altering it and adding to it as I went. It started out kind of frustrating and tedious because I didn't really understand what each part of the JavaScript was doing, but as I worked with it, it made more sense. I don't think I am equipped to create something like this fully from scratch on my own yet, but I was able to understand the example well enough to alter and add to it. Given more time, I might add to the CSS to make it more visually appealing, but I am currently happy with the result.
