        It is the dead of winter, and you are a stink bug who has somehow managed to survive this far into the cold season. You can feel your time running out and realize that you must find shelter to survive until spring. You enter the nearest house which happens to be multiple stories tall. You can sense that it would be safest to go to the top floor because heat rises, but it will be quite the trek. What do you do?
