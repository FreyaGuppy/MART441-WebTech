I have never used ChatGPT to assist with html or coding, and I was surprised with its work when I gave it the following prompt:

_Can you give me insturctions on how to write a program using javascript and html to complete the following assignment: [pasted in the homework assignemnt]_

It gave me detailed step by step insturctions and included comments in the code to explain what each part was doing. The AI included more information in the head than I did. It did not add an image, but it did include a title complete with a font choice. It also used the keyword 'let' where I used 'var'. Coincidentally, we chose the same bacgkround color (it is one of the default ones in VSCode).

If I were to just use the code written by ChatGPT, I would understand it for this assignment because of my familiarity with HTML and basic JS. However, the websites, artists and games that it chose are obviously not my personal favorites. I definitely would not call this work my own. It did provide a really great starting point for if I didn't want to write all the code myself, but that is only benificial if you do know how to then go in and alter the code to your needs.
