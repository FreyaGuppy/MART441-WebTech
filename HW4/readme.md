Project Reflection:

I had less time this week to work on this homework than previous weeks, so I haven't gotten it to a place that I am satisfied with yet. I am currently having trouble figuring out a way to include loops that will make sense for this project. The only way I've seen a loop be used so far is to display a list. I can't think of a way to use that in this project. I have a function that returns a value and takes a parameter, but I can't get it to work quite how I want (more details in main.js). Also could not figure out how to restart the story. 


ChatGPT Reflection:

I've been doing these at the end so that I give myself a chance to try the project without the help of AI, but ChatGPT's solution for this assignment is much more elegant than what I have been working on. I wonder if it would be better to start with ChatGPT to use as a framework, or if I only understand it to the extent that I do because of how much I have already wrestled with the project on my own. I am tempted to use the AI's solution as a template and start the project over. 

Once again its story is not interesting at all, the choices have little to do with what results from them. There is no 'adventure.' And I would change up the styling. But the javascript itself works well. The only thing it did not include was any kind of loop. I would be curious to see my classmates' solutions to this because I couldn't think of a way to use a loop for this project.
